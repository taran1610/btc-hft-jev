"""The deterministic state snapshot.

Everything computable stays in code. This module never calls Jev. It turns
an order book (or, on venues with no L2 depth, best bid/ask), a slice of
recent trades, and the loop's own bookkeeping (inventory, PnL, health,
session VWAP) into one compact dict under roughly 400 tokens.

Timestamp discipline: every price, trade and fill carries the real
timestamp the venue stamped on it (or, for the loop's own mid samples, the
wall-clock time it was read). Every field is computed only from points at
or before `as_of`, so nothing that happened after the decision clock
started can leak into the snapshot.

Honest degradation: on an asset with no Level 2 depth (US equities on the
basic feed), the caller passes empty depth lists rather than fabricated
ones. `imbalance` and the depth fields come back `None` / empty in that
case instead of a fake "balanced" reading.
