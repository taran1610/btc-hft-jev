The seven thresholds this reads come from strategy.py, the file you edit
to change how the loop trades: see StrategyThresholds and the
apply_strategy() hook there. This function never calls Jev. It only reads
the seven answers Jev already gave this tick. When the model gets faster,
cheaper, or replaced, this file does not change.
