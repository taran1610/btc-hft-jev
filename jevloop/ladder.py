"""The five-rung fallback ladder.

This is what makes "24/7" true past 2am, when the wifi drops or Jev has a
bad night. The loop always lands on exactly one rung per tick, and the rung
(not the model) decides whether to trade, shrink, hold, or flatten.

    healthy + high confidence  -> RUN         (normal operation)
    healthy + low confidence   -> REDUCE      (smaller size)
    late past block deadline   -> HOLD_LATE   (no stale quotes, ever)
    Jev unavailable            -> RULES_ONLY  (deterministic fallback only)
    hard limit breached        -> KILL        (flatten, stop, alert)
