"""strategy.py -- the file you edit to change how this loop trades.

This is the harness the video talks about, not the edge. Everything it
shipped with is a generic strategy pulled out of thin air, wired in only
so the demo has something to trade. Real strategies are hard to build
properly; this file is where yours goes.

Two things live here:

1. `StrategyThresholds`, one number per action in `compose_action()`
   (policy.py): when to pull quotes, when to widen, when the quote
   environment is good enough to quote both sides or just quote wide, how
   much inventory pressure skews sizing, and how confident Jev has to be
   about direction before a directional leg is taken. Change a number,
   restart the loop, see different behaviour on the next tick.

2. `apply_strategy()`, a hook called once per tick with the action
   `compose_action()` already produced from the thresholds above. Return
   it unchanged (the default) and nothing changes from what shipped in
   the video. Return a different action to override it, or an action
   with `kind=STAND_DOWN` to veto the tick outright. This is the one
   function a real strategy plugs into.

Shipped default: every threshold below matches what the video ran, and
`apply_strategy()` is a no-op. Nothing changes for someone who never
opens this file.

The hard risk caps (max position, max daily loss, max drawdown, and so
on) do NOT live here: they live in `jevloop/limits.py`, checked in
`risk.py` before every order, and this file cannot raise them. A
strategy can make the loop more conservative than the risk engine
allows; it can never make it less conservative than the risk engine
allows.

    To plug in your own strategy, edit this function. You can:
      - inspect `answers` (the seven Jev judgments this tick) or
        `snapshot` (the deterministic state) and return a different
        Action than the one compose_action() chose
      - veto the tick outright by returning
        `Action(STAND_DOWN, reason="my strategy said no")`
      - leave `action` alone most of the time and only step in on
        specific conditions

    `risk.py` still runs after this and still has the final veto, so
    nothing returned here can bypass a hard limit in limits.py, only add
    more caution on top of it.
