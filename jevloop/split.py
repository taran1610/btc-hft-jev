"""The split, enforced.

Deterministic layer (your code): exact arithmetic, hard metrics, safety
and policy. Probabilistic layer (Jev): fuzzy conditions, order-quality
judgments, execution-health judgments. Everything else in this scaffold
is built around that split; this file is the guard that keeps the second
half honest. It is the one place a battery question is allowed to be
defined, and it refuses anything whose instructions look like a request
for arithmetic rather than a judgment.
