"""Start / Stop for the loop, driven from the dashboard.

Two small files in ~/.jev-loop/ (or $JEV_LOOP_HOME):

  control.json   {"state": "RUNNING"} or {"state": "PAUSED"}. The loop reads
                 it before every order, so a press on the dashboard takes
                 effect on the next tick, and it survives a page refresh or
                 a restart of either process. No file means RUNNING.
  control.token  a random per-install secret, made the first time the
                 dashboard server starts. The dashboard sends it with every
                 Start/Stop press; anything without it is refused.

PAUSED stops new orders only. Market data, Jev decisions, the log and the
dashboard all keep updating. It does not close a position: the KILL switch
(the hard risk limits) does that, and still does while paused.
