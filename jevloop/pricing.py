"""Avellaneda-Stoikov reservation price and half spread, in basis points.

Fifty-year-old market-making maths. Stays in code. No model call, ever.
Jev never sees this file's output as a question. It only answers whether
the state is worth quoting into at all (policy.py). This file answers
where to quote.

Everything is worked out in basis points of mid, never in dollars, so the
same gamma and kappa give a sensible spread on an $85,000 coin and a $30
stock alike. (The first published version added the liquidity term in
dollars: about $1.29 each side, which is 0.3 bps on BTC and 860 bps on a
$30 stock.)

    q             = position value / max_position_usd   (-1 .. 1)
    reservation   = -q * gamma * sigma_bps^2 * T         (bps offset from mid)
    half spread   = gamma * sigma_bps^2 * T + (2 / gamma) * ln(1 + gamma / kappa)

sigma_bps is the per-minute realised volatility in bps, T the horizon in
minutes. The half spread is clamped to [min_half_bps, max_half_bps].
