"""The seven-question judgment battery.

One call, one latency, seven typed answers. Every question is atomic and
evaluated in isolation, and none of them ask Jev to weigh several factors
at once, and none of them ask Jev to trade or to calculate. That
composition happens in policy.py, in code, using the thresholds in
limits.py. The seven questions implement the three probabilistic rows in
the split (see split.py): fuzzy market conditions (regime, direction),
order quality (toxic_flow, liquidity_stressed), and execution health
(quote_environment, inventory_pressure, execution_health).

Question shape follows the verified TypeSafe / Vercel AI Gateway request
schema (see reference/systemone-request-shape.json):
  - noul needs only "instructions"
  - choice.criteria is a map of option -> description (or null)
  - score.criteria is an ARRAY of level descriptions, ordered low to high

Every question dict built here is checked against jevloop/split.py before
it is ever sent: if a question is off the allow-list, or its instructions
look like a request for arithmetic, the battery refuses to fire rather
than silently asking Jev to calculate something.
