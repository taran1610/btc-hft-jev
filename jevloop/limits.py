"""The hard risk caps, in one place. Never overridable by a strategy.

This is not the file you edit to change how the loop trades: that file is
strategy.py, which owns the tunable thresholds compose_action() uses and
a hook that can override or veto its output. This file owns the ceiling
that hook can never raise: nine limits, checked in risk.py before every
order, plus the operational numbers for ladder.py, pricing.py, and
execution/alpaca.py.
